This repository was created for the purpose of gaining deeper understanding of [this](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010561) paper, and the methods used in it.
The procedure i follow is:
1) Read and try to understand as much from the paper as i can
2) Try to rewrite the code for a simple RBM training using the same methods as are shown (really basic, functionally almost rewriting code provided in the paper's appendix, just to familiarize myself)
3) Try to re-implement RBM's from scratch (or just a custom, less general subset needed for this one use case )
